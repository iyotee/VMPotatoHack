Simply download the "VMPotatoHack" zip folder on your desktop, unzip and run the .bat file inside this folder. That's All !



It's gonna automatically give the UAC access for batch and then querying the Windows Registery for your Dekstop folder to be able to add a Windows Scheduled Task at every boot startup.

DEBUG : 
- Do not forget to download and put the folder on your desktop
